<P> The first blueprint of A block was constructed in 1998. ITB built A block around a field which was owned by a woman with goats and a caravan. </p>
<br>
<p> 150 years ago people were speaking Irish, the english language was a minority. Irish people were involved in every event and land was the only asset. The 'Down Survey' was carried out by Cromwell after the war to see what land was left.</p>
<br>
<p> On April 25th Fingal and The Rising took place. Volunteers made abortive attempts to destory railway lines at Blanchardstown and Cabra.</p>
<br>
<p>When The Famine took place over 1 million died and 1 million migrated. There was no vegetables or meat, only potatoes. During this time families were big. The older and younger people didn't survive the Famine. The Famine wasn't talked about because of the shock, guilt and tragedy. The British Imperial have documents on everything, the census data is also available online. </p>
<br>
<p> National schools emigrated in the 1800's. Boys were placed into one classroom and girls were placed in another. This was used to give them better behaviour. There was also a multitude of religions at the time. Books can be found in the Ilac centre. </p>
