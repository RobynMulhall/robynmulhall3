<P> ITB was first opened it's doors to students in 1999. It consisted of only one building and no pharmaseutical companies. We now know this building as A block. Rumour has it that the cement still wasn't dry as the students came in! The campus has also seen it's share of special guests over the years such as Bertie Ahern who contributed to the campus. Many pictures can be spotted around campus of Bertie. </p>
<br>
<p> Up until 2003 most of the activity in ITB took place through the Linc building, A block and the learning hub. By 2004 the big building project was completed. We began working on an institute of strategic plan until 2006 when the marketing unit launched. </p>
<br>	
<p> ITB's first social media page was a Bebo page however a Twitter account was needed in 2010 when the snow cancelled exams and students needed to be informed that the college was closed. In 2009 ITB celebrated their 10 year anniversary and hosted a fun day to celebrate. A 10 year logo was also created to show what they'd done over the years. </p>
<br>
<p> In 2012 ITB worked with TU Dublin. The legislation was passed in March of 2018 by the president, our new logo will launch in January of 2019 along with a combined advertisement campaign this year with DIT and ITT. </p>
