  <p> ITB's campus is known to have an abundance of nature, trees and eco areas. We'd also like to raise awareness of biodiversity on campus. The grove is a beautiful area suitable for wildlife species such as rens and robins. Our flowers on campus are suitable for insects and bees. We also have bramble bushes that support blackbirds and wet grassland consisting of grass and reeds around the pond located on our outer area of campus which are habitable environments for ducks, swans and various other species of bird</p>
  <br>
<p> Studies have shown that Hedgerows in Fingal County Council account for 1200ha of linear woodland cover. There's a huge drive to increase the woodland average in parks that originate as old demesnes.</p> 
<br>
	
	<b> Habitats observed on campus:</b>
<p> The observed habitats on campus consist of a variety of systems that support a large amount of wildlife. Some of the habitats observed include an amenity grassland and wildflower meadows. Cilium which are theb root/heart system of a fungi and litchen which are known as tiny growths found on trees can be seen on our campus when examined closely.</p>
<br>
	<b> Mixed grass species: </b> 
<p> Plant species are important to invertebrates, ornamentals play a role in ecology. On the ITB campus we have scrublands and a green oasis which is a marginal land that provides shelter and food for the wildlife living on campus. </p>
